README file 

My main code file is called nb11.py

 I have 3 python files named

 nb11.py The first file is used to obtain the accuracy and confusion matrix
 nb_plot_different_beta values.py the second is used to print the plot for different beta values
 nb_100words.py is used to print the ranked  hundered words.

 My code needs numpy and scipy,skilerankit,matlabplot.lib(for pltting semilogx graph) to run and the version of python is 2.7

 the data files are present in the data folder, so no need to change the path unless it throws an error.(If throws error pls check the file path in the python file)

 To run the code in cmd prompt use python FILENAME.py
