README file

My main code file is called music_genre_fft.py

 I have 3 python files named

 music_genre_fft.py The first file is used to obtain the accuracy and confusion matrix of FFT feature extraction
 Music_genre_fft_best20.py The first file is used to obtain the accuracy and confusion matrix of FFT feature extraction-(top 20 features)
 Mfcc_music_genre.py The first file is used to obtain the accuracy and confusion matrix of MFCC feature extraction

 My code needs numpy and scipy,skilerankit,matlabplot.lib to run and the version of python is 2.7

  Please check the path  while running the code unless it throws an error.(Update the file path location where the data is stored)

 To run the code in cmd prompt use python FILENAME.py
